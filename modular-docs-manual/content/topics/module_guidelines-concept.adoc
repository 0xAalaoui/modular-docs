= Concept Module Guidelines

The required part of a procedure module is the concept explanation. Optionally, the module can also include an introduction and additional resources.

When planning a concept module, look at nouns in related procedure modules and assemblies to find the concepts to explain to users. Explain only things that are visible to users. Even if a concept is interesting, it probably does not require explanation if it is not visible to users.

.Writing the Introduction

The introduction to a concept module is a single, concise paragraph that provides a short overview of the module. A short description makes the module more usable because users can quickly determine whether the concept is useful without having to read the entire module.

The introduction typically answers the following questions:

* What is the concept?
* Why should the user care about the concept?

.Writing the Concept Explanation

The concept explanation describes the subject of the concept module.

Apart from paragraphs, you can use other AsciiDoc elements, such as lists, tables, or examples. Consider including graphics or diagrams to speed up the understanding of the concept.

Do not include any instructions to perform an action, such as executing a command. Action items belong in procedure modules. See also link:http://www.informationmapping.com/fspro2013-tutorial/infotypes/infotype2.html[The Six Information Types] at _informationmapping.com_ for ways to present different types of conceptual information: principle, concept, structure, process, fact.

.Writing Additional Resources

The additional resources list links to other material closely related to the contents of the concept module: other documentation resources (such as assemblies or modules), instructional videos, labs, and similar resources.

.Adding Additional Resources
// [bhardest] - I don't think the latest concept module template has a section for additional resources/related links. If this section isn't useful, we can just remove it.
If necessary, you can provide a bulleted list of links to other concept, procedure, and reference modules that are closely related to this concept. Only include items that are likely to be of immediate interest to a user, not every item that could conceivably be related.
